## This is probably the simplest, but my favorite project so far.

#### Classified is simply a password manager, you can use it to create unique passwords to each website, save your credentials for that website, and copy paste these credentials when needed.

#### You can save as many website as you want and it's 100% free.

# Tech used:

#### Next.JS 14 server actions, Prisma with MongoDB, Next-Auth v5, NextUI, Shadcn, Tailwind css, and Typescript.

# Why I built this

#### I don't like having the same password for all the websites I use, I like creating a unique and complex password for each website.

#### To do that, I'd have to go to a password generation website, generate a complex password, then go to notion and create a new row for that website in a table that I built.

#### But the issue that I ran into is that on mobile if I want to copy the password from notion, the keyboard would popup and I'd be risking accidently editing the password.

#### Also this meant that I'd have to open notion just to get my email/password.

#### So I decided to make my own password manager that let's me generate a complex password, save it and copy it with a click of a button.

#### This means that on mobile, I don't have to manually select the password and copy it, I can click the copy icon next to the email/passwrod and it will do the job for me.

#### This is not just a "website" for the portfolio, I use this app all the time and all my passwords are stored there.

#### And the best part is, when using another password manager, you are storing your passwords in their database, but here I'm saving everything in MongoDB, wait... that's not safe either ðŸ¤¡
